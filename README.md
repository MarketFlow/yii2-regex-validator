# yii2-regex-validator
Validate regular expressions with Yii2

This validator validates if a given regular expression is a valid regular expression. It does this by trying to match a subject and catching any exceptions.

It does not (yet) support client side validation since Javascript and PHP have different RE syntaxes.
